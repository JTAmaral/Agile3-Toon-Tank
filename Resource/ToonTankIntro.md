## Agile 3: Toon Tank Features

In this game, your goal is to destroy every enemy turret and destroy the final boss tank without dying.
Players will start with 100 Health and lose 10 Health for every time they are hit with by an enemy turret.
Players will also have an opportunity to obtain a 100HP shield which will block all damage from inflicting one's health.
At the end of the game, players will be able to see a scoreboard of their performance.
